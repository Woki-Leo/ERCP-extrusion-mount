## What it does:
- combine spoolholder and buffer into a  really small and dense package 
- can be hung from the ceiling or placed on a level surface
- make spool changing fast and easy
- look cool

## What you need:
General:
- M5 threaded rod for the buffers (20mm + amount of buffers*20mm)
- M5 nuts
- M5 Flat head screws for the ends of the extrusions
- 2020 extrusion (this is designed for 5mm slot width but should work with 6mm as well)

per spoolholder+buffer combo:
- 5x 608 bearing
- M3x12 screws
- M3x5x4 threaded inserts
- ECAS04 
- 4mm OD/3mm ID PTFE tubing (dont use the clear stuffas its FEP)
- about 200g of filament

## How to assemble:
- cut M5 threads into extrusion ends
- install threaded inserts into the buffer frames
- press in ECAS04
- press in Spoolholder 608 adapter 
- press the buffer wheel assembly together
- put it together!

## What to look out for:
- the wheels should spin freely
- the bearings should spin freely
- the PTFE tubes should make nice slow bends as to not cause friction. I recommend feeling every tube by hand to get it right.
